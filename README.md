# REACT-downloader

**Overview:** This is a REACT appliaction that I built using Electron and ThreeJS to teach my self how to use the Nexton.js package that allows for seemless intergration with REACT to build sleek and clean desktop appliactions using web technologies. The app has a list of working features as well as features that I will be improving upon in the future as I learn and master them. 

**Purpose:** As a sample based music producer, I needed a way to get media from the internet easily and with out much hassle. This meant I needed a way to support audio capture and download at the click of a button or the pasting of a link. I am also making this project due to security concerns effecting more traditional "youtube too mp3" style web doowloaders. 

**Why:** I am also building this project to allow this application to help my fellow muscians and producers create a easier more secure workflow when sampling. Making the project open source and transparent will give confidence to those who use it to know that it they are not being mined, tracked, exploited or targeted. Electron allows for a localized and protected enviornment to do computative tasking which makes it a perfect choice for this project.
